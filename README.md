## 🤔 Why I Created This App

While filling out some online forms for **government or exam portals**, I often faced a frustrating issue:  
They wouldn't accept my photo because it was too large.

Like most people, I turned to **random online photo compressors**, but then a thought hit me:  
> ❗ “Am I risking my privacy by uploading personal images to unknown websites?”

So I decided to **build this app myself** – simple, open-source, and privacy-respecting.  
Now anyone (including me) can compress photos **without worrying about where their data ends up.**
